The purpose of this project is to play with and combine various technologies:
 * A (really) basic framework based on Restlets to manage dynamically web services
 * Java modularisation achieved through OSGI and declarative services
 * The use of BND to manage declarative services through anotations 
 * A build orchestrated by Maven
 * A project managed by PAX provision

My intention here is to discover (hands on) these technologies, no more ! About combining Restlets and OSGI you should chech out [Bryan Hunt's work](http://bryanhunt.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/osgi-at-rest/).
